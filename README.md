# CNN Image Classifier

### About:
The task was to develop a CNN that could accurately identify bird species from images. We used the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) environment for development. Our code was written in Python using using _Keras/TensorFlow_. The final notebook reached an accuracy of 71.30% on the test data and was developed on our PCs and the freely available Kaggle GPU resources, but without any pretrained models. Our group worked on this university project in SS 2022.

### Library:
- Data hanlding with standard libraries (_Pandas_, _Numpy_)
- Image import and preprocessing with _Keras/Tensorflow_
- Model build with _Keras/TensorFlow_
- Some metrics for evaluation with _Sklearn_
