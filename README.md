# CNN Image Classifier

### About:
The task was to develop a CNN that could accurately identify bird species from images. We used only the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) environment for development. The final notebook reached an accuracy of 71.30% and was developed on our PCs without any pretrained models. Our group worked on this university project in SS 2022.
