# CNN Image Classifier

## About
The task was to develop a CNN that could accurately identify bird species from images. We used the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) environment for development. Our code was written in Python using using _Keras/TensorFlow_. The final version reached  __71.30% accuracy on test data__. For developmemt we used our PCs and the freely available Kaggle GPU resources. No pretrained models were used.  
Our group worked on this university project in summer semester of 2022.

## Libraries
- Data handlding with standard libraries (_Pandas_, _Numpy_)
- Image import and preprocessing with _Keras/Tensorflow_
- Model build with _Keras/TensorFlow_
- Some metrics for evaluation with _Sklearn_
